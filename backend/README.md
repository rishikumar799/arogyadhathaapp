Backend for Arogyadhatha (Next.js) — API routes for signup, login, and admin approval.

Commands:

cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

API routes:
- POST /api/signup
- POST /api/login
- POST /api/approve

Make sure to set .env.local (we added one in repository) and never commit production keys publicly.
